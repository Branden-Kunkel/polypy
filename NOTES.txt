__Notes for 'polypy' repo__

- Recently reminded myself that there is no error handling for a situation in which the program files are not .yaml. -> fix that

- First goal after unit testing should be to add any remaining api endpoints to the program

- need to add verbosity to the program as an option -> working on it. Need to add an if statement to guage whether to be verbose or not
